# 🏥 Health Hub – Healthcare Web App

Health Hub is a **doctor–patient collaboration platform** designed to make healthcare more accessible, transparent, and efficient.  
It allows **patients** to connect with doctors through video calls, chat, prescriptions, and donations.  
Doctors can manage patient bookings, verify donations, and share important updates in the collaborative hub.

## 🚀 Features

### 👨‍⚕️ For Doctors
- Manage **video consultations** (video call powered by Jitsi / WebRTC).
- View and respond to **outbreak reports**.
- Send **digital prescriptions** to patients.
- Moderate and verify **donations** via the Collaborative Hub.
- Manage own **posts & fundraising campaigns**.

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 For Patients

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript  
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS  
- **UI Components:** shadcn/ui  
- **State & Hooks:** React Hooks  
- **Database & Auth:** Firebase Realtime Database + Firebase Authentication  
- **Media Storage:** ImgBB (for image uploads)  
- **Video Calls:** Jitsi Meet API / WebRTC  
- **Deployment:** Netlify (serverless hosting)

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Authentication**  
   - Users sign in with Firebase Auth.  
   - Doctors and patients are identified based on email roles.

2. **Doctor Dashboard**  
   - Shows waiting patients, outbreak reports, feedback, prescriptions, and donation hub.

3. **Collaborative Hub**  
   - Doctors create posts with captions, images, and UPI IDs.  
   - Patients can donate → enter transaction ID → donation goes to **pending verification**.  
   - Doctor verifies → donation marked as successful.  

4. **Video Consultation**  
   - Jitsi / WebRTC integration for real-time audio-video communication.

## 🖥️ Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/health-hub.git
   cd health-hub
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Add environment variables:

   * Create a `.env` file in the root with:

     ```
     VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_key
     VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
     VITE_FIREBASE_DB_URL=https://your_project.firebaseio.com
     VITE_IMGBB_API_KEY=your_imgbb_key
     ```

4. Run locally:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Deploy on **Netlify**:

   * Connect GitHub repo to Netlify.
   * Add the `.env` variables in Netlify’s dashboard.
   * Build command: `npm run build`
   * Publish directory: `dist`

---

## 🌍 Deployment

We use **Netlify** for:

* Hosting frontend React app.
* Handling HTTPS & custom domain.
* Serverless deployment (no backend server needed).

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Replace Jitsi with **pure WebRTC** for more control.
* Add **offline-first support** using service workers.
* AI-powered **symptom checker** integration.
* Multi-language support for accessibility.
